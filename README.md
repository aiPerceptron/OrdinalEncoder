# OrdinalEncoder transformer

## NOTE: 
this is not the same transformer as ChatGPT (the t stands for transformer).
This scikitlearn transformer takes text and turns it into numbers.

## Example:
if I fit the OrdinalEncoder with a list that says "hello", and "bye", then transform said list, it will replace "hello" with 0, and "bye" with 1.
